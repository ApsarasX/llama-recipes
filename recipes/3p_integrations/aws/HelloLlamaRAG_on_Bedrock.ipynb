      " The author of the book \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" is Clayton Christensen. Clayton Christensen is a Harvard Business School professor and a renowned expert in the field of innovation and strategy. He is known for his work on the concept of disruption, which he introduced in his book \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" in 1997. Christensen has written several other books, including \"The Innovator's Solution\" (2003), \"The Innovator's Prescription\" (2009), and \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" (2012). He has also published numerous articles and case studies on innovation and strategy in top-tier academic and business journals. Christensen's work has been widely cited and has had a significant impact on the way companies approach innovation and strategy. He is considered one of the most influential management thinkers of the past few decades. Here is a short summary of his background and other works: Clayton Christensen was born in 1959 in Salt Lake City, Utah. He earned his undergraduate degree from Brigham Young University and his MBA and Ph.D. from Harvard Business School. After completing his Ph.D., Christensen joined the Harvard Business School faculty, where he has been a professor since 1992. Christensen's research focuses on innovation, strategy, and organizational design. He is known for his work on the concept of disruption, which he introduced in \"The Innovator's Dilemma.\" In this book, Christensen argues that established companies often struggle to innovate and adapt to new technologies and business models because of their existing strengths and resources. He also argues that companies that are able to disrupt existing markets and business models are often those that are able to create new markets and opportunities. Christensen has written several other books that build on his work on disruption and innovation. \"The Innovator's Solution\" (2003) provides a framework for companies to develop and implement innovative solutions. \"The Innovator's Prescription\" (2009) applies the concept of disruption to the healthcare industry. \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" (2012) is a more personal book that explores the question of how to measure success and happiness in life. Christensen has also published numerous articles and case studies on innovation and strategy in top-tier academic and business journals. He is a frequent speaker at conferences and has been a guest on various TV and radio programs. Christensen is considered one of the most influential management thinkers of the past few decades, and his work has had a significant impact on the way companies approach innovation\n"
