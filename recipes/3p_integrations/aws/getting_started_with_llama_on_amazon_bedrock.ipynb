    "### Resources\n",
    "Set up the Amazon Bedrock API - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/api-setup.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. Amazon Bedrock provides the following service endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bedrock** – Contains control plane APIs for managing, training, and deploying models.\n",
    "* **bedrock-runtime** – Contains runtime plane APIs for making inference requests for models hosted in Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "* **bedrock-agent** – Contains control plane APIs for creating and managing agents and knowledge bases.\n",
    "* **bedrock-agent-runtime** – Contains control plane APIs for managing, training, and deploying models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "Before you can access Amazon Bedrock APIs, you will need an AWS Account, and you will need to request access to the foundation models that you plan to use. For more information on model access - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html\n",
    "\n",
